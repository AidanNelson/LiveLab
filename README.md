## About LiveLab | https://livelab.app
LiveLab is a browser-based media routing software designed for collaborative performance by [CultureHub](https://culturehub.org), a global art & technology community founded by SeoulArts & La MaMa.

It is a new tool that empowers artists  and arts presenters to meet, create, collaborate, rehearse, and ultimately produce multi-location performances from virtually anywhere in the world. This innovative video collaboration software expands the current field of offerings by allowing users to customize media in ways that best suit their needs.

**Feature highlights:**
- add multiple cameras, audio streams, and screen shares to the same session from one laptop
- dynamically add and remove audio and video feeds
- send video feeds to separate windows
- use audio mixer to control the master volume as well as the output volume of individual feeds
- video switcher to switch between video feeds
- chat, who doesn't like?
